# Bootcamp @Laboratoria

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Laboratoria/curricula-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Laboratoria/curricula-js)

## Introduction

Our _bootcamp_ is a 6 month immersive training program focused on **Front End
Development** and **UX Design**. Our learning methodology tries to mimic the
workplace and revolves around completing a series of _projects_ of increasing
complexity.

Each _project_ is accompanied by a number of suggested _topics_ and _self-paced_
materials.

Projects are assessed by _coaches_ and _peers_ using a standardised [_rubric_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSkQy1waRpQ-16sn7VogiDTy-Fz5e7OSZSYUCiHC_bkLAKYewr4L8pWJ_BG210PeULe-TjLScNQQT_x/pubhtml#),
which always includes _general_, _soft skills_, _tech_ and _ux_ sections.

## Learning Roadmap

The _learning/projects roadmap_ is divided into 4 _stages_: **Admission**,
**Common Core**, **Deep dive** (Front End Dev and UX Designer tracks) and
**Capstone**.

```text
                           => Front End Dev => Capstone
                         //
Addmission => Common Core
                         \\
                           => UX Designer => Capstone
```

### Stage 0: Admission

The _admission_ stage starts _before_ being accepted into our Bootcamp. At the
end of each _admission process_ selected candidates will be invited to work on a
_project_ in our premises.

### Stage 1: Common core

Once admitted into our Bootcamp, everyone starts with the _common core_. At this
stage you will work in the following _projects_ in order, each unlocking the
next one. At the end of the _common core_ stage students participate in a series
of _hackathons_ working on smaller projects proposed by 3rd party
companies/employers.

  `localStorage`, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Stage 2: Deep dive

After the _common core_ stage each group splits into two _specialised_ tracks:
_JavaScripters_ and _UXers_. During this stage students can work on two projects
in parallel.

#### Front End Dev (JavaScripters)

their own pace - you are expected to work on a _capstone_ project, which can
either be based on the topics/technologies covered so far, or can cover any of
the suggested topics (electives).
