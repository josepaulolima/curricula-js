# Test Coverage

**Test coverage** is the extent to which our tests verify our code. A program
with behaviors a, b, c and d and tests verifying a, b, c and d has 100% test
coverage. A program with behaviors a, b, c and d with tests verifying only a and
b has 50% test coverage. When writing tests for our code, we always want to aim
for 100% coverage.
