# Test Driven Development

With our unit tests updated, we can implement the new requirement to
`areValidCredentials` with full confidence in our solution works when all our
unit tests pass. What weâ€™ve just done (writing tests to verify requirements
before implementation) is called **Test Driven Development**. You've already
been doing Test Driven Development through your code challenges.

Imagine if we had implemented the new requirement before revising our tests.
Would we have remembered to update the character length unit tests? Maybe or
maybe not. The more complicated our code and unit tests become, the more things
we'll have to remember and the more things we'll inevitably forget. Test Driven
Development is a strategy to ensure our tests stay up-to-date and thorough.
